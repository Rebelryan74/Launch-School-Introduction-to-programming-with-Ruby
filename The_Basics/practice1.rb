puts "Ryan " + "Trentham"

# Here we are using string concantenation to combine
# both of these names together we use puts to print this 
# to the screen and following that we have each name
# inside of quotes seperated by the + sign the + sign will
# combine the two strings together.  Notice the space
# after the first name Ryan that will put a space between
# the names when they print out to the screen.
